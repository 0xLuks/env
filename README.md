# Kali-Clean

My kali i3 desktop setup. Some people have been asking so I wrote a quick installer to get going. After cloning the repo just run ./install.sh . This installs a lot of stuff, including all nerd-fonts, so it will take a while. Feel free to optimize ;)

## Installation

```
./install.sh
```
